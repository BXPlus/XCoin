## Functionalities
	
- XCoin is a green cryptocurrency, that uses energy-efficient algorithm to make transaction in a decentralized fashion.
- Use PKC (Public-Key Cryptography) to validate the authenticity of the transations using asymetric encryption (RSA-like).
	- Public Key is used to received money, it will be the address of the user, therefore it has to be known by the sender. 
	- Private Key is used to unlock the transaction and access the fund, it is used to proved ownership.
- The following will be implemented in game-like manner in order to enhance the user experience and make it more enjoyable.
	- The user will have the possibility to consult his balance and therefore own a wallet (first digital, maybe physical in the future).
	- In the sofware the user enters the address of the recipient and sends money. It will be removed obviously only if the transaction is verified (block created and verified, broadcast the blockchain to all users, etc).
	- The user will receive a notification when receiving funds, and therefore it applies automatically his private key and this would validate the transaction.

   ## Deadlines and deliverables

   - What intermediate deadlines do you have, and what subset of functionalities will you deliver in each deadline?

   Try to plan different stages for your project and have intermediate results you can show for each stage. This exercise will help you focusing your efforts and minimize the risks of failure.

   ## Software Architecture

   - How are you sub-dividing your project?Which modules are you implementing?

   - What is the interface of each module?
      You can define the interface with the public section of your class headers (note that not all classes need to be "exposed" from one module to the others).

   - What external dependencies do you have? Why?

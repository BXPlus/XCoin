# Week 1: 1st to 7th of November

@Cyrus Pellet 

This week I implemented the CMake configuration for the project and made some unit tests for the blockchain.

Next week, I will finish the tests for the blockchain core and start adding some tests for the API when it is ready. I will also coordinate library imports in the frontend branch if needed.

@Youssef Chaabouni 

This week I worked on implementing the Blockchain. For that, I first started by creating a basic minimal working Blockchain, then I improved it by developing a PoS (Proof of Stake) method).

Next week, I will continue improving the Blockchain by working on the transactions part.

@Kevin Messali 

This week I added all the instructors on Notion. I also scaffolded the architecture of the API, in other terms how are we going to make requests and what kind of requests. I also found the candidate libraries that we might want to use to create a REST API on each device.

Next week, I will import the libraries and create the main classes.

@Mamoune Mouchtaki 

- This week:

       I studied how to use qmake and CMake (TD8) and set up the project in CLion.

      I made some research about currency and how transactions works.

- Next week:

     I will continue my research of last week and start with the currency team thinking about how we are going to implement our exchange system and the different issues that we may encounter. 

@Malo 

- This week
    - I studied the PoS mechanism
    - Understood how works two kind of possible attacks : nothing at stake and long-range / history attacks
    - understood the RSA encryption
- Next week
    - How to avoid nothing at stake and long-range attacks
    - start study the API architecture
    

@Lio 

- **DURING THE TD:**
    - learned how to compile manually multiple files,
    - learned how to link my code with an external library.
- **FOLLOWING THE TD:**
    - learned how to automate the building process + installed cmake (that we will use for XCoin),
    - learned how to set up the project in CLion and link it with Github,
    - understood the **REST** design principles and how this can be useful for our API.
- **NEXT WEEK:**
    - read documentation about Pistache and WebSockets
    - Organise a brainstorm of the API team by zoom
    - No TD (11th of November)

@Picha 

**This week:**

Finished Tutorial 8 (cmake & qmake & build system)

I searched for the definition of a currency and how we could implement it in our project.

I found a tutorial that would be helpful to follow in order to start coding the currency

**Next week:**

I will continue to work on how implementing a currency to the token.

I'll start the tutorial found about currency.

@Tim Valencony 

This Week:

- Learned how to use cmake and qmake, as well as how to compile, modify the build system and add new source code files
- Helped start the set up of the front end workspace with the Qt library
- Added everyone to the GitHub repository

Next Week:

- Finish setting and tidying up the front end workspace in order to separate tasks inside of the front-end team
- Work on my separate task once it is done.

@Laura Galindo 

This week I started researching about the different issues that we could encounter using the Proof of Stake (PoS) technology in blockchain.
Next week I will continue doing this, and begin searching for possible solutions to the issues found.

@Clara  

This week, I installed Cmake and learned how to modify the building process. Also, I did some research to understand what API is. I looked at libraries that can be useful for implementing the API (Pistache and easywsclient). 

Next week, we will meet with the API team and separate the tasks. 

@salma zainana 

This week I read some documentation about different types of cyberattack. I also learned how to use Cmake and Qmake through the tutorial session.

For next week, I am planning to read more documentation about the proof of stake technology in blockchain as we might use it and discuss more details with the security team in order to move forward.

@Alex 

- find an adequate library for the user interface (most probably Qt with Qt Creator)
- set up the front-end work space
- try to already have an interface to separate the tasks amongst front-end team
- next week: start working on individual app page

@Jean-Sebastien G. 

This week:

Research and contacted a professional regarding the blockchain (talked about a platform called: CakeDefi).

Started the Transaction part of the implementation (read and talked about it with a professional)

Next Week:

Implement the transaction part of the blockchain

Check if any bugs are still left in our prior code

@arthur 

This week, I installed and learned how to use cmake. 

Read some documentations on the front end to understand how it works and create an interface.

Next week, we will try to seperate the tasks between the front end team.
